## The Next Web homepage replica

This project was built by [Giuliana](https://github.com/gferrarocamus) and [Valentino](https://github.com/1ba1) using HTML and CSS. The aim of this project was to mimic the responsive behavior of [The Next Web's homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20190305092250/https://thenextweb.com/) using media queries, while also trying to replicate its overall style.
